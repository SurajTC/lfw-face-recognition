# Comparative Study of Data Representation Methods 

## Evaluation of SVM and kNN classifiers using different data representation methods on Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset

- This project aims to evaluate the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers using different data representation methods on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

#### **How to run this project?**

1. Clone or download this repository.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:SurajTC/lfw-face-recognition.git
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file [`LFW_classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/SurajTC/lfw-face-recognition/blob/main/LFW_Classifcation.ipynb) in Google Colab.
3. Run each cell in the notebook to reproduce the results.

>Note: You will need to have an active internet connection to download the LFW dataset.
 
#### **Results**
The study demonstrates that the choice of data representation method can significantly affect the performance of the classifiers. The results suggest that Factor Analysis is a promising data representation method for achieving high accuracy and F1-scores with both SVM and kNN classifiers.

#### **Summary**
This project provides insights into the performance of SVM and kNN classifiers using different data representation methods on the LFW dataset. It highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate data representation method when training classifiers for image recognition tasks.
