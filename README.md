# Comparative Study of Data Representation Methods 

> Evaluation of SVM and kNN classifiers using different data representation methods on Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset

This project aims to evaluate the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers using different data representation methods on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

### Installing / Getting started

Clone or download this repository.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:SurajTC/lfw-face-recognition.git
```
Open the Jupyter Notebook file [`LFW_classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/SurajTC/lfw-face-recognition/blob/main/LFW_Classifcation.ipynb) in Google Colab.
Run each cell in the notebook to reproduce the results.

> Note: Iternet connection is required to download and run the project.
 
### Results
The study demonstrates that the choice of data representation method can significantly affect the performance of the classifiers. The results suggest that Factor Analysis is a promising data representation method for achieving high accuracy and F1-scores with both SVM and kNN classifiers.

### Summary
This project provides insights into the performance of SVM and kNN classifiers using different data representation methods on the LFW dataset. It highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate data representation method when training classifiers for image recognition tasks.
